# Tic-Tac-Toe
Why play Tic Tac Toe yourself when you can have a program play it for you?

This is a graphical game of Tic Tac Toe automatically played in a terminal. 
To start, run `python game.py`.
The individual boards of each turn will be printed, as well as the result of the game at the end.

[Small chance the program bugs out and produces an error.]

This was made as an assignment for my computer science class
