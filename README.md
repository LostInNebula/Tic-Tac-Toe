# Tic-Tac-Toe
Why play Tic Tac Toe yourself when you can have a program play it for you?

This is a graphical game of Tic Tac Toe automatically played in a terminal, made in python.
To start locate the directory in which the file is stored, enter: 'python3 -i game.py' then enter: 'tic_tac_toe()' into the terminal. (MacOS)
The individual boards of each turn will be printed, as well as the result of the game at the end.

[Small chance the program bugs out and produces an error.]


This was made as an assignment for my computer science class
