# Tic-Tac-Toe
Why play Tic Tac Toe yourself when you can have a program play it for you?

This is a graphical game of Tic Tac Toe automatically played in a terminal. 
To start, enter: 'tic_tac_toe():' into the terminal.
The individual boards of each turn will be returned, as well as the result of the game at the end.


This was made as an assignment for my computer science class
